          <p>Surrealism is an art style that expresses the irrational and subconscious mind through the use of automatic drawing, juxtaposition, distortion of reality, and borrowing elements from dreams. <br> (Wolfe, n.d.)

            <img id="HisImg1" src="../images/PersistenceDali.png" alt="The Persistence of Memory, by Salvador Dali"
              title="From Dali (1931)">

            <p id="His1">The term ‘Surrealism’ comes from the French word surréalisme, meaning "beyond realism". It was coined as a literary movement by Guillaume Apollinaire in 1917 and in 1924, his student, André Breton, later defined and used it as an artistic movement also, in his book Manifeste de Surréalisme. It mostly originated from Dada, an earlier nihilistic movement in 1916 that also focused on the illogical and bizarre through art. Surrealism flourished in Europe between World Wars I and II, opposing the society’s oppressive rationality at the time. Breton proposed that it also taps into the unconscious mind, a normally unused wellspring of creativity, based on the psychoanalytical research of Sigmund Freud. (Online Etymology Dictionary, 2014), (Encyclopedia Britannica, 2022), (Artland Magazine, n.d.)

            <img id="HisImg2" src="../images/SonMagritte.png" alt="The Son of Man, by Rene Magritte"
              title="From Magritte (1964)">

            <p id="His2">An example that encapsulates surrealism well is The Persistence of Memory by Salvador Dalí (Top) as melting pocket watches and a mollusk-like creature contrast the brown and barren coastline of his native Catalonia, Spain as he remembers, in “...a landscape near Port Lligat, whose rocks were lighted by a transparent and melancholy twilight; in the foreground an olive tree with its branches cut, and without leaves.” He used a process called the paranoiac critical method to access his subconscious to make this “hand-painted dream photograph”. <br><br> The Son of Man (Left) is a self-portrait of René Magritte wearing an overcoat and a bowler hat with his face mostly obscured by a green apple hovering over it. (The Museum of Modern Art, n.d.) <br>
“At least it hides the face partly. Well, so you have the apparent face, the apple, hiding the visible but hidden, the face of the person. It's something that happens constantly. Everything we see hides another thing, we always want to see what is hidden by what we see. There is an interest in that which is hidden and which the visible does not show us. This interest can take the form of a quite intense feeling, a sort of conflict, one might say, between the visible that is hidden and the visible that is present," Magritte commented about the painting. (ReneMagriette.org, n.d.)

              title="From Suzi Nassif (2021).">

            <p id="Tips1"><span>1.) Combining a living object with an inanimate one.</span><br> The absurdity will capture the attention of the viewer and may think that the inanimate object itself is a living creature.<br><br>
              <span>2.) Purposely making the painting incomplete. </span><br> This would give a sense of uncanniness as the observer tries to fill in the gaps themselves making the work very surreal.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <img id="TipsImg2" src="../images/DoubleMagritte.PNG" alt="Go wild"
              title="From Craven (2019).">

            <p id="Tips2"><span>3.) Realism but with a twist!</span><br> Most of the methods used for realism art such as color choices and transitioning works well for surrealism. Obviously, you would still have to change a major thing or two to get that strange but alluring atmosphere. <br><br>
              4.) <span>Go Wild..</span><br> Part of the experiences of surreal art is how absurd and abstract they can get. Try combining two very different and unrelated things along with a very realistic aesthetic and see how well they would actually fit together.</p>
