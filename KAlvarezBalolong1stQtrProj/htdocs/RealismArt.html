          <p>Realism primarily focuses on creating a realistic and accurate depiction of objects or events. This type of
            art rejects imaginative features in favor of more detailed physical appearances. <br> (Britannica, 2022)

            <p id="His1">Realism became a style during the mid-19th century in France. Widely present in French novels
              and paintings during the 1850s, the word “realism” itself was first used to describe a doctrine focused on
              summarizing what it offered to the writer in his time. Thus, realism not only refers to the real life
              appearance but the essence of the contemporary as well.</p>

              title="From The Artist Editorial (May 2022).">

            <p id="His2">Gustave Courbet was one of, if not, the first artist to push for the realism aesthetic. One of
              his works, “The Painter’s Studio” (top), along with other pieces, were put under a label he called
              “Realism, G. Courbet”. Another one of his famous paintings, “A Burial at Ornans” (left), struck the
              audience for showing peasants and labor workers as they are, truly reflecting the state of his period.

              title="From Fine Art Tutorials (2022).">

            <p id="Tips1"><span>1.) Have a variety of brushes / pencils.</span><br> Realism relies on the fact that they look similar to
              real life and not stylized. Having different types of drawing materials for specific occasions can
              effectively bring the details out better.<br><br>
              <span>2.) Sketch out the illustration first or have a draft.</span><br> No one wants to deal with a drawing with no
              direction, or commit far into it only to realize you created a large inaccuracy at the beginning. To save
              yourself from some pain, having an effective layout drafted first enables you to plan and visualize the
              final product better.</p>

              title="From Fine Art Tutorials (2022).">

            <p id="Tips2"><span>3.) Transition elements smoothly.</span><br> In real life, we will not find outlines in everyday objects
              to express shape usually. The visual differences are that distinguishes them. This can range from gradual
              light levelling, avoiding sharp edges unless necessary, and the color values. <br><br>
              4.) <span>Know the color aesthetic beforehand.</span><br> Most often, realism images consists of many different shades of
              color, all with harmony with each other. Choosing what colors to blend with another wisely while sticking
              to a theme can bring out another layer of reality in the piece.</p>
